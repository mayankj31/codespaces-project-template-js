# React Portfolio Website
## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to my Portfolio Website, a project I developed using the React framework. This site is designed to showcase my personal brand, projects, and accomplishments as a software developer.

Through this project, I aimed to create a responsive and dynamic platform where visitors can easily navigate through my work, learn about my background, and connect with me via social media links. I hope you find the site informative and enjoyable to explore!

## ✨ Features

-> Responsive Design: The portfolio is optimized for viewing on all devices, from desktop to mobile, ensuring a seamless user experience.

-> Component-Based Structure: Each section of the site is built as a reusable React component, making it easy to update and expand over time.

-> Dynamic Data Management: Core personal details like name, title, and social links are centrally managed in the code, allowing quick updates as needed.

-> Fast and Lightweight: Using Parcel as the bundler, the application remains highly optimized for performance, ensuring quick load times.

-> Customizable Styles: The design is easy to tweak and adapt, making it perfect for reflecting your unique brand.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
